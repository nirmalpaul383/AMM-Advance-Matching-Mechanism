# AMM-Advance-Matching-Mechanism
a small function that matches two binary arrays and returns a matching percentage based on the user-specified matching accuracy rate(How accurately to match)
Basically, it takes two binary arrays, shrinks them into 2 new arrays (processed arrays), compares those shrunk arrays, and returns a matching percentage(%).
The user can control how much the raw arrays will be shrunk with the rate of matching accuracy.
I have already explained this concept in the Diagram.pdf file of this project.
